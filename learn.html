    <h2>About Contact Uploading and How It Works</h2>
    <p>When a user uses contact uploading and grants us access to their device's address book, we will access and upload the names, phone numbers, and email addresses in their address book on a daily basis to our servers.</p>
    <h2>What Information Is Collected About Non-Users?</h2>
    <p>We collect the name, mobile phone number, and/or email address of a user's contacts.</p>
    <h2>How Do We Use a Non-User's Information?</h2>
    <p>Contact uploading is an optional feature where users can choose to upload their device's address book. We process the names, phone numbers, and/or email addresses in the address book to see if any of the numbers or email addresses belong to users.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, we will also use the address books uploaded to investigate suspicious activity and keep our platform safe and secure. We also conduct business intelligence and analytics using the address books uploaded to accurately count people and users of the Company.</p>
